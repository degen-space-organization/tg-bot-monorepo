# Docker directory

This directory houses everything required to run the project
in a controlled environment

Ideally you would be using the root level scripts to manage the runtime
but feel free to stray off and implement certain helpers if needed

Try to keep everything docker-related in here (with the exemption of `Dockerfiles` for smaller projects)
