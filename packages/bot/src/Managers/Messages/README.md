# Messages Manager

This manager is mostly orionted towards bot that have inputs that arent commands

My advice is to handle these scenarios with scenes and `ScenesManager.ts` but in certain cases thats not possible
so the messages manager should be dedicated to that cause

Again, add specific handlers for certain types of messages in this dir
