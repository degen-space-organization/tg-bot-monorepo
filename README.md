Im building this using:
- node LTS/Hydrogen - 18.16.0
- yarn v4.3.1

Using the yarn workspaces with `nodeLinker: node-modules` 

In the coming-up commits ill elaborate on stuff

### Installation

To install the project locally, simply run `yarn install` at the root level of the project.
This should extract the yarn cache with the modules currently installed in the repo

For developers: please provide guidance on how to run the project in certain environments, just in case
